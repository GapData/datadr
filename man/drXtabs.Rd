\usage{
drXtabs(formula, data = data, by = NULL, transFn = NULL,
  maxUnique = NULL, control = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{a \code{\link{formula}} object with the
  cross-classifying variables (separated by +) on the right
  hand side (or an object which can be coerced to a
  formula). Interactions are not allowed. On the left hand
  side, one may optionally give a variable name in the data
  representing counts; in the latter case, the columns are
  interpreted as corresponding to the levels of a variable.
  This is useful if the data have already been tabulated.}

  \item{data}{a "ddf" containing the variables in the
  formula \code{formula}}

  \item{by}{an optional variable by which to split up
  tabulations (i.e. tabulate independently inside of each
  unique "by" variable value).  The only difference between
  specifying "by" and placing it in the right hand side of
  the formula is how the computation is done and how the
  result is returned.}

  \item{transFn}{an optional function to apply to each
  subset prior to performing tabulation.  The output from
  this function should be a data frame containing variables
  with names that match that of the formula provided.}

  \item{maxUnique}{the maximum number of unique
  combinations of variables to obtaion tabulations for.
  This is meant to help against cases where a variable in
  the formula has a very large number of levels, to the
  point that it is not meaningful to tabulate and is too
  computationally burdonsome.  If \code{NULL}, it is
  ignored.  If a positive number, only the top and bottom
  \code{maxUnique} tabulations by frequency are kept.}

  \item{control}{parameters specifying how the backend
  should handle things (most-likely parameters to
  \code{rhwatch} in RHIPE) - see \code{\link{rhipeControl}}
  and \code{\link{localDiskControl}}}
}
\value{
a data frame of the tabulations.  When "by" is specified,
it is a named list, with each element corresponding to a
unique "by" value, containing a data frame of tabulations.
